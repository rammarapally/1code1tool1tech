# MOAT

you guessed it right! Mother Of All Technologies.

Contributions to all the technologies which are gonna transform current and future tech.

These technologies relate to current day Artificial Intelligence, Blockchain, Cloud computing, industrial IoT, Quantum computing.

1. Artificial-Intelligence: Decision-making capability to machines aka Humanity's attempt at becoming creator.
2. Blockchain: Great Trust building technology with open distributed ledger at its heart (because we don't trust governments and organizations anymore).
3. Cloud-computing: Next-level scaling of computing resources have transformed the computing operations in all industries making them more efficient and cheap. That's what I am talking about (economies of scale).
4. Industrial-IoT: I call it initial landscape of Cybertron (Robots making more Robots).
5. Quantum-Computing: bye bye binary computing, we're gonna see evolutionary advancements in computing if we figure out applications for that.


This file is going to change constantly. And I'm gonna try and contribute to buiding these next-gen tech.
