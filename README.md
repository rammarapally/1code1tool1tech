you guessed it right! Mother Of All Technologies.

Contributions to all the technologies which are gonna transform current and future tech.

These technologies relate to current day Artificial Intelligence, Blockchain, Cloud computing, Industrial IoT, Quantum computing.

1. Artificial-Intelligence: Decision-making capability to machines aka Humanity's endeavor of becoming creator.
2. Blockchain: Evolutionary trust building technology with open distributed ledger at its heart (because we are skeptical towards governments and organizations).
3. Cloud-computing: Hyperscale computing has transformed everything, making computing resources more efficient and affordable. (Now that's what I call economies of scale).
4. Industrial-IoT: Making mega-scale resource-management autonomous.
5. Quantum-Computing: bye bye binary computing, evolutionary advancements if we figure applications for it.


This file is going to change constantly. And I'm gonna try and contribute to buiding these next-gen tech.
