Characterisitcs of AI. Taking the cues from all life forms

Life is sensory (Living beings can feel towards surroundings and react)
Life is intelligent, on multiple levels ( take decisions based on knowledge gained and intuition available)
Life transforms matter and energy around it (Absorb -> Process -> Extract -> Emit)
Life can pass-on what it learned through DNA (change or evolve)
Living beings are dextrous

So AI should have sense aka sensors to absorb data about everything
AI should be intelligent to transform this sensory-data into information and take decisions
AI should be able to transform matter and energy
AI should be able to evolve with every lesson and grow to the need
AI should be dextrous and be able to manipulate

Sense-Process-Decide-Manipulate-Evolve
